    <h1>3. Images in HTML</h1>
   <p>The img element and its src attribute are used to embed an image in HTML.</p> 
<xmp><img src="/images/myimage.jpg" alt="" width="100â€œ height="150"> 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipaish/www2020/master/docs/images/header.png ">
<img src="images/missing.jpg" alt="Photo info"/>
<img src="images/missing.jpg" alt="Photo info" height="200px" width="200px"/>
  </xmp>
  <h1>Image Sizes</h1>
    <p>
        You may use width and height attribute to size image however it is recommended to use photo 
        editing software to determine the size of images to produce a better result. Resizing
        images properly will download faster when users view your pages.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Image size can also be specified as a windows percentage. </h2>
      <xmp> 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipaish/www2020/master/docs/images/header.png " alt="Photo info" width="30%"/>
      </xmp>
        </p></p>
  <h2>Alternative Text</h2>
  <p>The <b>alt </b> attribute
  is a textual description of the image that is displayed 
to the user when am image is not found or takes a long time
to render due to slow internet connection. It is also 
handy for visually impaired user who is using a screen 
reader to read the web.</p>
<xmp>
<img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="info about image">
</xmp>
<h2>Image Titles</h2>
<p>The <b>title</b> attribute in image provides a tooltip on mouse over.It is 
however not recommended due to various accessibility problems.
</p>
<xmp>
  <img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="info about image" title="more info">
  </xmp>
  <h2>Image Captions in HTML5</h2>
  <p>You can use &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figurecatpion&gt; elements.</p>
  <xmp>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="image 2;">
    <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </xmp>
  
    <h1>Understanding Image URLS & Important Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The src attribute in img tag locates the image file</li>
        <li>There are two types of URLs: Absolute & Relative</li>
        <li>Absolute: The exact location of the image that normally begings with http://....</li>
        <li>Relative: To better organize, images are stored within a specific folder. In such cases, 
            you can use relative location such as images/image1.jpg </li>
            <li>Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO.
               Therefore, it is wise to use a descriptive image  filename; apple.jpg is better than img135.png.</li>
            <li>Make sure, you own copyrights before
              displaying an image in your webpage. </li>
              <li>
                Images garner attention and draw 
                emotion therfore use images wisely as people
                pay more attention to image than text.
              </li>
              <li>Try to limit larger size images as much as possible so that they are not slowing down your website.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h1> Example 1: Image and Content</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such 
    as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
     into multimedia web pages. 
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
     the appearance of the document. </p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipaish/www2020/master/docs/images/header.png" >
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
         web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
         has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 199</p>
