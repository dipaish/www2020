<h1 id="html">What is HTML?</h1>
  <p>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language
that tells browser how to structure a web page.

  <h2>A sime HTML document looks like this</h2>
  <xmp>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
     <head>
      <title>My page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1>My page</h1>
      <p>This is a <a href="link">simple</a> Link</p>
      <!-- this is a comment -->
     </body>
    </html>
    </xmp>
    As in the above example, html document consists of a <b>tree</b>
    of elements and text. Each element starts with a <b>tag </b>b>
    and ends with a tag. Tags have to be <b>nested</b>b> such that 
    they are completely within each other without <b>overlapping </b>.
