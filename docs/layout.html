<h1>Buidling a layout for HTML pages</h1>
<p>We can usee <b>CSS</b> to create page layouts and control the position of our html 
    elemets. There are several layout techniques however we will go through
some of them</p>
<h2>Normal Flow</h2>
<p>You don't do anything for the layout, the normal flow will take the html 
    elements as you have written them in your html code. The elements will be displayed
    in the <b>same order</b> as it appears in the <b>source code</b>. The elements that appear
    one after another are <b>block elements</b> and the ones that appear in the same
    line are <b>inline elements</b>. <br>
</p>
<strong>Example of Normal Flow layout:</strong> <br><br>

<h2>Flexbox</h2>
<p>The flexbox make things easier to put html elemets either in a row or a column. </p>
<p>To use flex box, you use <b>display:flex </b> to the parent html element. All child elements
with then become flext items.</p>
<p class="note">
   Unfortunately, Flexbox is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier versions.
</p>
<strong>Example of a flexbox layout:</strong>

<h2>Floats</h2>
<p>The float property was introduced to allow web developers to 
    implement simple layouts involving an image floating inside 
    a column of text, with the text wrapping around the left or right of it.
     The kind of thing you might get in a newspaper layout.
    Floats  are commonly used to 
    create entier website layouts.
