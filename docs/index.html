  <h1 id="html">1. What is HTML?</h1>
  <p>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language
that tells browser how to structure a web page. 
  </p>
  <h2>A sime HTML document looks like this</h2>
  
  <xmp>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
     <head>
      <title>My page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1>My page</h1>
      <p>This is a <a href="link">simple</a> Link</p>
      <!-- this is a comment -->
     </body>
    </html>
    </xmp>
    <ol>
      <li><xmp class="list"> <!DOCTYPE html>:</xmp>
        <p>
          It is simply meant to act as links to a set of rules tht the HTML page had to follow.
           In current time, rarerly anyone cares about it however it is recommended to start with the DOCTYPE.
        </p></li>
      <li><xmp class="list"><html></html>:</xmp> <p>This element simply wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.</p></li>
      <li><xmp class="list"><head></head>: </xmp><p> This element acts as a container for all the stuff (keywords, page description,css, character set declarations and more) 
        you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.</p>
      </li>
    <li><xmp class="list"><title></title>:</xmp> <p>his element defines the title of your page, that appears 
      in the browser tab and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</p></li>
      <li>
       <xmp class="list"> <body></body>:</xmp> <p>This element contains all the content that is displayed to web users such as text, images, videos or games.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>
      As in the above example, html document consists of a <b>tree</b>
      of elements and text. Each element starts with a <b>tag </b>
      and ends with a tag. Tags have to be <b> nested </b>such that 
      they are completely within each other without <b>overlapping </b>. 
  </p>
  <xmp>
    <p>This <em>is <strong>correct</strong>.</em></p>
    <p>This is <em>very <strong>wrong</em>!</strong></p>
  </xmp>
  <p class="note">
    Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive, i.e. they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. 
    Best practice, however, is to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.
  </p>

  There are two important categories of elements in HTML. 
  <ul>
    <li>Block Level Elements:</li>
    These elements appear one after another on a new line that is they are tend to be structural elements on the page. 
    <br>Example: 
    <xmp>
      <em>element 1</em> <em>element 2</em> <em>element 3</em>
    </xmp>
    <li> Inline Elements:</li>
    These elements are contained within the block level elements tht is it does not cause a new line to appear in the document. 
    <br>Example:
    <xmp>
      <p>paragraph 1</p><p>paragraph 2</p><p>paragraph 3</p><p>paragraph 4</p>
    </xmp> 
  </ul>

  <h2>Whitespaces in HTML </h2>
  <p>The whitespace includes space characters as well as line breaks. You can have lots of whitespaces in your code but the HTML parser
  reduces space(s) or line breaks into a single space when rendering the HTML code. There is no reason to use more white spaces as it
  might affect the readability if it is not nicely formatted. </p>
  <xmp>
    <p> this is properly formatted in terms of whitespaces</p>
    <p>this is 
      very                    random and is not effective enough when 
      reading 
      the 
      code. 
    </p>
  </xmp>
<h2> Using Special Characters in HTML</h2>
<p>
  <b >&lt;, &gt; , &quot; and &amp; </b> are special characters which are parts of HTML syntax, Therfore, when you need to 
  use them in your html code you need to use the character equivalent as in the table below, to not have it interpreted as code. 
</p>
<table >
  <tr>
    <td>HTML Character</td><td>Equivalent Character Reference</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;</td><td><xmp class="list">&lt;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;</td><td><xmp class="list">&gt;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&quot;</td><td><xmp class="list">&quot;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&apos;</td><td><xmp class="list">&apos;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;</td><td><xmp class="list">&amp;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<h2> Comments in HTML</h2>

<p>
  It is a good idea to write comments whereever applicable. Comments are ignored by the browser and are invisible to the user. <br>
 <b> To type comment in HTML: </b>
  &lt;!-- comment 
  asdsad
  asdasda
  --&gt;
  <!-- this is a comment
  it can go to multiple lines-->
</p>

 <h1>Exercise 1: Text Formatting</h1> 
 <p>Visit any website of your choice. Make an HTML page that has roughly the same content. You don't need to worry about formats, backgrounds or colors. The main objective is to 
 use elements and tags correctly in HTML. You will includ all codes that are explained in the lecture. The formatting for the text could be as below: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Start yout html code with doctype, head and a proper title. </li>
   <li>The top level heading of the page can be heading 1</li>
   <li> Put some random text pieces in the the &lt;p&gt; tag</li>
   <li>Add a couple of random link to some external pages.</li>
   <li>Make some part of your text bold</li>
  </ul>
