  <h2 id="html"> What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language
that tells browser how to structure a web page. HTML is made up of sereis of elements such as a piece of text, a pragraph,
, list, table, links or forms.
<h2>Lets write the following line of text in a text file and save it as file1.html</h2>
<xmp>I am learning to develop web pages</xmp>
Now lets use the paragph tag by modifying file1.html
<xmp><p>I am learning to develop web pages.</p></xmp>  
</p>
<p class="note">
 Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. 
   This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase.
    However, it is strongly recommended to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.

</p>
  <h2>A simple HTML document looks like this</h2>
  
  <xmp>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
     <head>
      <title>My page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1>My page</h1>
      <p>This is a <a href="link">simple</a> Link</p>
      <!-- this is a comment -->
     </body>
    </html>
    </xmp>
    <ol>
      <li><xmp class="list"> <!DOCTYPE html>:</xmp>
        <p>
          It is simply meant to act as links to a set of rules tht the HTML page had to follow.
           In current time, rarerly anyone cares about it however it is recommended to start with the DOCTYPE.
        </p></li>
      <li><xmp class="list"><html></html>:</xmp> <p>This element simply wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.</p></li>
      <li><xmp class="list"><head></head>: </xmp><p> This element acts as a container for all the stuff (keywords, page description,css, character set declarations and more) 
        you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.</p>
      </li>
    <li><xmp class="list"><title></title>:</xmp> <p>his element defines the title of your page, that appears 
      in the browser tab and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</p></li>
      <li>
       <xmp class="list"> <body></body>:</xmp> <p>This element contains all the content that is displayed to web users such as text, images, videos or games.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="elements">HTML Elements</h2>
    <p>
      As in the above example, html document consists of a <b>tree</b>
      of elements and text. Each element starts with a <b>tag </b>
      and ends with a tag. Tags have to be <b> nested </b>such that 
      they are completely within each other without <b>overlapping </b>. 
  </p>
<xmp><p>This <em>is <strong>correct</strong>.</em></p>
<p>This is <em>very <strong>wrong</em>!</strong></p>
</xmp>
  <p class="note">
    Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive, i.e. they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. 
    Best practice, however, is to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.
  </p>

  There are two important categories of elements in HTML. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Block Level Elements:</b></li>
    Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
    <br>Example: 
    <xmp>
      <p>paragraph 1</p><p>paragraph 2</p><p>paragraph 3</p><p>paragraph 4</p>
    </xmp>
    <li> <b>Inline Elements:</b></li>
    These elements are contained within the block level elements that is it does not cause a new line to appear in the document. 
    <br>Example:
    <xmp>
      
      <em>element 1</em> <em>element 2</em> <em>element 3</em>
    </xmp> 
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 id="#white">Whitespaces in HTML </h2>
  <p>The whitespace includes space characters as well as line breaks. You can have lots of whitespaces in your code but the HTML parser
  reduces space(s) or line breaks into a single space when rendering the HTML code. There is no reason to use more white spaces as it
  might affect the readability if it is not nicely formatted. </p>
  <xmp>
    <p> this is properly formatted in terms of whitespaces</p>
    <p>this is 
      very                    random and is not effective enough when 
      reading 
      the 
      code. 
    </p>
  </xmp>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="spe"> Using Special Characters in HTML</h2>
<p>
  <b >&lt;, &gt; , &quot; and &amp; </b> are special characters which are parts of HTML syntax, Therfore, when you need to 
  use them in your html code you need to use the character equivalent as in the table below, to not have it interpreted as code. 
</p>
<table >
  <tr>
    <td>HTML Character</td><td>Equivalent Character Reference</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;</td><td><xmp class="list">&lt;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;</td><td><xmp class="list">&gt;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&quot;</td><td><xmp class="list">&quot;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&apos;</td><td><xmp class="list">&apos;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&amp;</td><td><xmp class="list">&amp;</xmp></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="com"> Comments in HTML</h2>

<p>
  It is a good idea to write comments whereever applicable. Comments are ignored by the browser and are invisible to the user. <br>
 <b> To type comment in HTML: </b>
  &lt;!-- comment 
  asdsad
  asdasda
  --&gt;
  <!-- this is a comment
  it can go to multiple lines-->
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<! -- start of the new section: text formatting -->
<h1 id="textf"> Text formatting in HTML</h1>
<p>
  HTML is used to structure text within a page
  by adding headings, paragraphs, emphasizing words
  and more. 
</p>
<p>The structured content provides
  a better and enjoyable reading experience.
</p>
<p>Headings are to be wrapped in a heading element <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>. 
There are 6 level of heading elements <b>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;,
  &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;,&lt;h5&gt; &amp; &lt;h6&gt;.
</b> </p>
<p>Paragraphs are wrapped in a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b></p>
<xmp>
<h1>My heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</xmp>
<h2>Example of a structure</h2>
<img src="images/structure1.PNG" height="300px">
<h2>Lists: Unordered</h2>
<xmp>
<ul>
<li>Deepak</li>
<li>Markku</li>
<li>Pekka</li>
<li>Juha</li>
</ul>
</xmp>    
<h2>Lists: Ordered</h2>

<xmp>
<ol>
<li>Deepak</li>
<li>Markku</li>
<li>Pekka</li>
<li>Juha</li>
</ol>
</xmp>    


<h2>Lists: Nested</h2>
<xmp>
<ol>
<li>Chapter 1</li>
<li>Chapter 2</li>
<li>Chapter 3</li>
<li>Chapter 4
<ul>
<li>Chapter 4.1</li>
<li>Chapter 4.2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</xmp>

<h2> Importance</h2>
<p>It is sometimes needed to emphasize certain words
within your text. HTML provides several 
semantic elements to mark up 
textual content with different effects. 
</p>
<p><b>Emphasis:</b> &lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;This is 
<em>emphasized text.</em> </p>
<p><b>Bold:</b> &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;This is 
<b>bold text.</b> </p>
<p><b>Strong:</b> &lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;This is 
<strong>strong text.</strong> </p>
<p><b>Italic:</b> &lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;This is 
<i>italicized text.</i> </p>
<p><b>Underline:</b> &lt;u&gt;...&lt;/u&gt;This is 
  <u>underlined text.</u> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 id="ex1">Exercise 1: Text Formatting</h2> 
  <p>Visit any website of your choice. Make an HTML page that has roughly the same content. You don't need to worry about formats, backgrounds or colors. The main objective is to 
  use elements and tags correctly in HTML. You will include all codes that are explained in the lecture. The formatting for the text could be as below: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start yout html code with doctype, head and a proper title. </li>
    <li> The HTML head is the contents of the <xmp><head>....</head></xmp> element. 
      The content of the head element is not displayed to the user. It contains metadata
    about the document such as the author information, the title of the page, 
  the metadata element such as the document's character encoding, custom icon to your page,
link to the CSS and JavaScript file that are applied to the pages, primary language of the document,
<b>Your task is to include a proper tile, the author information,set the character set as utf-8 and a brief 
description that is used on a search engine result pages.For this task, please consider
reading this document:</b> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML" target="_blank">Link</a>

</li>
    <li>The top level heading of the page can be heading 1</li>
    <li> Put some random text pieces in the the &lt;p&gt; tag</li>
    <li>Add a couple of random link to some external pages.</li>
    <li>Apply some text formatting such as bold, italic, underline to some part of your text.</li>
    <li> Add an image to your page</li>
   </ul>
